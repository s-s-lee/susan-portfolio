# Susan's Portfolio

## Description

Hey, I'm Susan Lee. I currently live in Philadelphia, PA and I work with clinical drug trials for children with GI diseases caused by food allergies. However, I finally decided to pursue my true interests and joined a full-stack coding bootcamp. I'm excited to switch gears and become a full-stack web developer!

My portfolio site includes my past projects, resume, and contact info.
