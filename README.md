### [Aquarium](https://s-s-lee.github.io/code-refactor/)

Due to a work conference, I missed attending the first 2 classes on JavaScript. However, I got to visit the Georgia Aquarium which is home to two grey sharks &#128011; &#129416;, manta rays, and sting rays!

### [Origami Sculpture](https://s-s-lee.github.io/code-refactor/)

I also visited the Atlanta Botanical Gardens and felt refreshed by nature. They had beautiful origami sculptures all throughout the garden.
