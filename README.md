# Susan's Portfolio

## Description

Hey, I'm Susan Lee. I currently live in Philadelphia, PA and I work with clinical drug trials for children with GI diseases caused by food allergies. However, I finally decided to take a leap and join a coding bootcamp. I'm excited to switch gears and hopefully become a full-stack web developer.

My portfolio site includes my past projects, resume, and contact info.

## Projects I worked on

### [Gritty Wear](https://grittywear.herokuapp.com//)

Gritty Wear offers the best Gritty gear for you and your loved ones without paying a premium price AND the chance to get a discount code if you beat Gritty in a game!

Mobile friendly e-commerce site that uses the Stripe API to process discount codes and to securely checkout.

### [Ars Animatio](https://github.com/RahsanLewis/ARS-Animatio/)

Created a search engine site that searches GIPHY for a GIF and a random programming joke from a Geek Jokes API.
