# Susan's Portfolio

## Description

Hey, I'm Susan Lee. I currently live in Philadelphia, PA and I work with clinical drug trials for children with GI diseases caused by food allergies. However, I finally decided to take a leap and join a coding bootcamp. I'm excited to switch gears and hopefully become a full-stack web developer.

My portfolio site includes my past projects, resume, and contact info.

### [Ars Animatio](https://github.com/RahsanLewis/ARS-Animatio/)

Created a search engine site that searches GIPHY for a GIF and a random programming joke from a Geek Jokes API.

### [Origami Sculpture](https://s-s-lee.github.io/code-refactor/)

I also visited the Atlanta Botanical Gardens and felt refreshed by nature. They had beautiful origami sculptures all throughout the garden.

## Technology that I want to specialize in

So far, I am hoping to specialize in React, Node, and JavaScript!
